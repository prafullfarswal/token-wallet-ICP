Token Wallet for ICP Blockchain
This project implements a Rust-based token wallet for the ICP blockchain, supporting basic functionalities such as sending and receiving IRCRC2 tokens. It demonstrates your proficiency with Rust, blockchain principles, and the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) smart contract development.

Project Overview
The Token Wallet allows users to interact with the ICP blockchain, supporting these core features:

Send Tokens: Users can send tokens to other addresses.
Receive Tokens: Users can receive tokens and update their balance.
Get Balance: Users can view the current token balance of their wallet.
The wallet's core logic is written in Rust and deployed as a smart contract on a local ICP testnet.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Rust: Install Rust if you haven't already.
dfx: The Internet Computer SDK. You can install it by running the following command:
bash
Copy
Edit
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
Steps to Set Up and Run the Project
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd token_wallet
Start the ICP Local Testnet: Start the local ICP test network using the dfx command:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx start
Deploy the Canisters: Deploy the smart contract canisters to the local testnet:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx deploy
Check Canister Status: After deployment, you can check the status of the deployed canisters:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx canister status token_wallet_backend
Interacting with the Wallet
After deploying the canisters, you can interact with the token wallet via dfx commands. Here are some example interactions:

Send Tokens: To send tokens, you will need to specify the receiver's Principal ID and the amount to send:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx canister call token_wallet_backend send_tokens '(<principal>, 10)'
Receive Tokens: To receive tokens and add them to the balance, you can use:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx canister call token_wallet_backend receive_tokens '(10)'
Get Balance: To view the current balance of the wallet:

bash
Copy
Edit
dfx canister call token_wallet_backend get_balance '()'
Running Unit Tests
To ensure everything is working as expected, you can run the unit tests for the smart contract:

Run Tests: You can run the tests using Cargo, the Rust package manager:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo test
This will compile the code and run all the unit tests written in tests.rs.

Unit Test Examples:

Test sending tokens with insufficient balance.
Test sending zero tokens.
Test receiving zero tokens.
Code Structure
The project follows a clean code structure to separate logic and facilitate easy testing:

src/token_wallet_backend
lib.rs: Contains the smart contract logic, including wallet functions (send_tokens, receive_tokens, get_balance) and the initialization code.
tests.rs: Contains unit tests for the smart contract, verifying the core functions like sending, receiving tokens, and checking the balance.
Security Features
The wallet implements basic security features to ensure safe transactions:

Validation:
Ensures that the amount being sent or received is greater than zero.
Checks if the wallet has sufficient funds before sending tokens.
Mutex Locking:
The wallet balance is protected by a Mutex to ensure thread safety in a concurrent environment.
Testing the Smart Contract
To test the functionality of the smart contract:

Test Edge Cases:
Ensure that sending tokens with insufficient balance fails with the appropriate error message.
Ensure that sending zero tokens is not allowed.
Ensure that receiving zero tokens is not allowed.
Run Test Suite:
Execute the unit tests to validate that the smart contract behaves correctly for all possible scenarios:
bash
Copy
Edit
cargo test
